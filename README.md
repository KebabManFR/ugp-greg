## Welcome to GTCEu-UGP
### What is this?
GTCEu for UGP, or **GTCEu-UGP**, is a Minecraft mod. The repository contains all the code and assets required to build and run that mod.

This mod is about **technology** and **progression**.
* From simple crude tools which will allow you to process resources more realistically...
* Through **No Steam Age**, it has been removed...
* To many **Electric Ages** where increasingly complex machines and logistics will become indispensable parts of your industrial regime.

All of which are powered by GTCEu's own power systems, featuring generators from simple wood burning for steam to plasma-powered turbines.

## Contribution
